- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
The order of execution for the given code is as follows:
foo
done
Read Error
1. `someAsyncOperation()` is called.
2. Inside `someAsyncOperation`, a non-blocking operation `fs.readFile()` is initiated, which reads data from a file asynchronously. This operation is scheduled to run in the background, and the callback function provided to `fs.readFile()` will be executed once the file reading is complete.
3. `foo()` is called.
4. Inside `foo()`, 'foo' is logged to the console.
5. 'done' is logged to the console.
6. Eventually, the file reading operation initiated by `fs.readFile()` completes. Depending on the file system's speed and the size of the file, this may take some time.
7. When the file reading operation is complete, its callback function is pushed onto the event queue.
8. The event loop picks up the callback function from the event queue and pushes it onto the call stack.
9. Inside the callback function:
   - If there was an error during the file reading operation, 'Read Error' is logged to the console.
   - Otherwise, 'Data: ' followed by the contents of the file is logged to the console.

Explanation of the order of execution with respect to the event loop phases:

- When `someAsyncOperation()` is called, it initiates an asynchronous operation (`fs.readFile()`), which is handled by the Node.js runtime and doesn't block the main thread.
- `foo()` is called immediately after `someAsyncOperation()`.
- Both `someAsyncOperation()` and `foo()` are synchronous functions, so they are executed one after the other on the main thread.
- After `foo()` is called, 'done' is logged to the console.
- Meanwhile, `fs.readFile()` is still running asynchronously in the background.
- Once `fs.readFile()` completes, its callback function is pushed onto the event queue.
- The event loop then picks up the callback function and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.
- This mechanism ensures that even though `fs.readFile()` is asynchronous and doesn't block the main thread, its callback is executed when the operation completes, allowing non-blocking I/O operations in Node.js.
