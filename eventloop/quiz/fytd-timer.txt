- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

The order of execution for the given code is as follows:

1. `foo(2)` is called.
2. Inside `foo` function:
   - 'foo' is logged to the console.
   - `setTimeout` is called with a callback function to execute `bar(a)` after a timeout of 0 milliseconds.
   - `baz()` is called immediately.
3. 'baz' is logged to the console.
4. The event loop picks up the callback function from `setTimeout` and executes `bar(a)`.
5. Inside `bar` function:
   - `${x} : bar` is logged to the console with the value of `a`.
6. `foo(1)` is called and the same sequence of steps (2-5) is repeated.

Explanation of the order of execution with respect to the event loop phases:

- When `foo` is called, it gets pushed to the call stack.
- Inside `foo`, 'foo' is logged, `setTimeout` is called, and `baz()` is executed. Since `setTimeout` has a delay of 0 milliseconds, its callback function is scheduled to be executed after the current execution context finishes and the event loop has a chance to pick it up.
- After logging 'foo' and calling `baz()`, `foo` finishes executing and is popped off the call stack.
- The event loop picks up the callback function from `setTimeout` since it's completed its timeout period. The callback function (which logs `bar(a)`) is pushed onto the call stack and executed.
- Once `bar(a)` finishes executing, it's popped off the call stack.
- Finally, the event loop picks up the next task, which is the call to `foo(1)`, and the process repeats.

So, the order of execution is 'foo', 'baz', 'bar(2)', 'foo', 'baz', 'bar(1)'.
